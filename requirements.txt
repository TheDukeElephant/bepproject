Do You Have to Reinitialize the Database on Every Startup?
No, you don’t need to initialize the database every time you restart the Raspberry Pi. Here's why:

Persistent Database:

The SQLite database (users.db) is a file stored on your Raspberry Pi’s filesystem.
Once you run setup.py to create the database and add a user, the data is stored persistently in users.db. Restarting the Raspberry Pi won’t delete this file unless you explicitly remove it.
What Happens on Startup:

The init_db() function in run.py ensures the database schema exists (i.e., the users table is created if it doesn’t exist). If the table is already there, it does nothing.
You only need to run setup.py if you want to reset the database or add the first user.
When Do You Need setup.py?

On the first run to initialize the database and create the default user.
If you manually delete users.db and need to recreate it.

Steps for Restarting the Raspberry Pi
After a reboot, you only need to:

Start the application:

bash
Copy code
python run.py
Your database (users.db) will remain intact with all existing users.
